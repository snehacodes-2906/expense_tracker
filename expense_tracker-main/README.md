Project Approach
1. Breaking the Project into Parts

 I divided the project into smaller parts and implemented them step by step. This made it easier for me to focus on one section at a time, such as setting up the environment, building the UI, adding expense input, and integrating storage and charts.

2. Step-by-Step Implementation

Setup: The first and most difficult step was setting up Flutter and Android Studio correctly.

UI: I created a simple interface for adding expenses and viewing them.

Data Handling: I worked on saving and retrieving expense data.

Charts: I added basic visualization to show spending patterns.

3. Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge for me was that Dart was a completely new language.

4. Learning Outcomes

I learned the importance of breaking projects into smaller parts to make progress faster.

I got experience in setting up Flutter and Android Studio, which is a valuable skill for future projects.

This project gave me a starting point in Dart and Flutter, and I plan to continue learning the language and framework more deeply after this experience.
